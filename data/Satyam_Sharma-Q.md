1.In contract of function LineOfCredit.counts always returing default values: 

function counts() external view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return (count, ids.length);
    }
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L117

No use of function counts in contract LineOfCredit only a wastage of gas as it uses and return only the default values.

2.Necessary zero address check should be done in CreditLib.getOutstandingDebt on variable address interestRate..
  As address interestRate is used in many function inside and outside of contract and if this address leads to wrongly implement intersetRate than it will effect LineOfCredit._accure function
