## Non-Critical Risk Findings(9)
### NC-1. Order of Functions
##### Description
According to [Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/style-guide.html#order-of-functions), ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and to find the constructor and fallback definitions easier.  
Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:
1) constructor
2) receive function (if exists)
3) fallback function (if exists)
4) external
5) public
6) internal
7) private
##### Instances
receive() function at the end but should be after constructor:
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/credit/SpigotedLine.sol#L272

external functions between internal:
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/credit/SecuredLine.sol#L48-L104

public functions before external:
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol#L34-L84
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol#L29-L58

##### Recommendation
Reorder functions where possible.
#
### NC-2. Order of Layout
##### Description
According to [Order of Layout](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/style-guide.html#order-of-layout), inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:
1) Type declarations
2) State variables
3) Events
4) Modifiers
5) Functions
##### Instances
Modifiers after constructor:
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L78
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/interest-rate/InterestRateCredit.sol#L25

##### Recommendation
Place modifiers before constructor.
#
### NC-3. No space between the control structures
##### Description
According to [Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/style-guide.html#control-structures), there should be a single space between the control structures ```if```, ```while```, and ```for``` and the parenthetic block representing the conditional.
##### Instances
- [```for(uint256 i; i < len; ++i) {```](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/CreditListLib.sol#L23) 
- [```for(uint i = 1; i < len; ++i) {```](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/CreditListLib.sol#L51) 
- and 85 instances of ```if(```

##### Recommendation
Change:
```
if(...) {
    ...
}
```
to:
```
if (...) {
    ...
}
```
#
### NC-4. Open TODOs
##### Instances
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/factories/LineFactory.sol#L140
- https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/factories/LineFactory.sol#L145
