#### Event is missing indexed fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol
    event ClaimRevenue(
        address indexed token,
        uint256 indexed amount,
        uint256 escrowed,
        address revenueContract
    );

    event ClaimEscrow(
        address indexed token,
        uint256 indexed amount,
        address owner
    );
``` 


#### Unused/empty `receive()/fallback()` function

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. require(msg.sender == address(weth))). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/modules/spigot/Spigot.sol
    receive() external payable {
        return;
    }
```

#### Code Structure Deviates From Best-Practice

The best-practice layout for a contract should follow the following order: 
- state variables
- events
- modifiers
- constructor
- functions

Function ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and find constructor and fallback functions easier. Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:
- constructor
- receive function (if exists)
- fallback function (if exists)
- external
- public
- internal
- private
- within a grouping, place the view and pure functions last

Suggestion: 
Consider adopting recommended best-practice for code structure and layout.


#### require() statements should have descriptive reason strings

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/modules/credit/SpigotedLine.sol
62       require(defaultRevenueSplit_ <= SpigotedLineLib.MAX_SPLIT);
143      require(amount <= unusedTokens[credit.token]);
160      require(msg.sender == borrower);
239      require(msg.sender == arbiter);

// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol
91       require(amount > 0);
105      require(msg.sender == ILineOfCredit(self.line).arbiter());
161      require(amount > 0);
198      require(amount > 0);
216      require(msg.sender == self.line);

// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol
128      require(revenueContract != address(this));
130      require(self.settings[revenueContract].transferOwnerFunction == bytes4(0));
180      require(newOwner != address(0));
187      require(newOperator != address(0));
201      require(newTreasury != address(0));
```



#### Missing Equivalence Checks in Setters

Description: Setter functions are missing checks to validate if the new value being set is the same as the current value already set in the contract. Such checks will showcase mismatches between on-chain and off-chain states.

Suggestion: 
This may hinder detecting discrepancies between on-chain and off-chain states leading to flawed assumptions of on-chain state and protocol behavior.

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol
    function updateOwnerSplit(SpigotState storage self, address revenueContract, uint8 ownerSplit)
    function updateOwner(SpigotState storage self, address newOwner) external returns (bool) {
    function updateOperator(SpigotState storage self, address newOperator) external returns (bool) {
    function updateTreasury(SpigotState storage self, address newTreasury) external returns (bool) {
    function updateWhitelistedFunction(SpigotState storage self, bytes4 func, bool allowed) external returns (bool) {
``` 

#### Missing Time locks

When critical parameters of systems need to be changed, it is required to broadcast the change via event emission and recommended to enforce the changes after a time-delay. This is to allow system users to be aware of such critical changes and give them an opportunity to exit or adjust their engagement with the system accordingly. None of the onlyOwner functions that change critical protocol addresses/parameters have a timelock for a time-delayed change to alert: 
- users and give them a chance to engage/exit protocol if they are not agreeable to the changes 
- team in case of compromised owner(s) and give them a chance to perform incident response.

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol
    function updateOwnerSplit(SpigotState storage self, address revenueContract, uint8 ownerSplit)
    function updateOwner(SpigotState storage self, address newOwner) external returns (bool) {
    function updateOperator(SpigotState storage self, address newOperator) external returns (bool) {
    function updateTreasury(SpigotState storage self, address newTreasury) external returns (bool) {
    function updateWhitelistedFunction(SpigotState storage self, bytes4 func, bool allowed) external returns (bool) {
``` 

Suggestion: 
Users may be surprised when critical parameters are changed. Furthermore, it can erode users' trust since they can’t be sure the protocol rules won’t be changed later on. Compromised owner keys may be used to change protocol addresses/parameters to benefit attackers. Without a time-delay, authorized owners have no time for any planned incident response. (May be medium since owner can change critical parameters at anytime that can affect the users poorly).


#### Events not emitted for important state changes

When changing critical state variables events are not emitted. Emitting events allows monitoring activities with off-chain monitoring tools.

Instances number of this issue: 2
```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol
    function updateLine(EscrowState storage self, address _line) external returns(bool) {

// Line-of-Credit/contracts/modules/escrow/Escrow.sol
    function updateLine(address _line) external returns(bool) {
``` 

Suggestion:
Consider emitting events after sensitive changes take place, to facilitate tracking and notify off-chain clients following the contract’s activity.


#### comment is misleading

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/modules/oracle/Oracle.sol
11
 *          - only makes request for USD prices and returns results in standard 8 decimals for Chainlink USD feeds

20
    /**
     * @return price - the latest price in USD to 8 decimals
     */
    function getLatestAnswer(address token) external returns (int) {

// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/CreditLib.sol
    * @dev            - Assumes Oracle returns answers in USD with 1e8 decimals
    * @param price    - The Oracle price of the asset. 8 decimals

    * @return         - The total USD value of the amount of tokens being valued in 8 decimals 
```

The comment indicates that the returned price is in 8 decimal, actually it is not, each feed could return different decimal.


#### `borrow()` does not follow check-effect-interaction pattern

Although it does not seem to lead to fund loss, the queue sort could potentially be messed up. And check-effect-interaction pattern is always a good practice.

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol
    function borrow(bytes32 id, uint256 amount) {
        // ...
        LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(credit.token, borrower, amount);
        // ...
        _sortIntoQ(id);
        // ...
    }
```

Suggestion:
For the `borrow()` function:
- add `nonReentrant` modifier 
- follow check-effects-interaction pattern

#### need way to remove collateral

Currently can only add new collateral, but if some assets were depreciated, they should be removed.

Suggestion:
Add some method to remove the collateral.
