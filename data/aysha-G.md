Using > 0 costs more gas than != 0 when used on a uint in a require() statement
This change saves 6 gas https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/zeppelin/original/2X/3/363a367d6d68851f27d2679d10706cd16d788b96.png per instance. The optimization works until solidity version 0.8.13 https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/bf2c3120f24a69e489f12b3213c06c94 where there is a regression in gas costs.

Using bools for storage incurs overhead
Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled. https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/58f635312aa21f947cae5f8578638a85aa2519f5/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L23-L27 Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past

Multiple address mappings can be combined into a single mapping of an address to a struct, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (20000 gas) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save ~42 gas per access due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash: https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0 (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

Functions Guaranteed To Revert When Called By Normal Users Can Be Marked Payable
If a function modifier such as onlyOwner is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2),DUP1(3),ISZERO(3),PUSH2(3),JUMPI(10),PUSH1(3),DUP1(3),REVERT(0),JUMPDEST(1),POP(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost
