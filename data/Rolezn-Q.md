## Low Risk Issues

### <a href="#Summary">[LOW&#x2011;1]</a><a name="LOW&#x2011;1"> Missing Checks for Address(0x0) 

Lack of zero-address validation on address parameters may lead to transaction reverts, waste gas, require resubmission of transactions and may even force contract redeployments in certain cases within the protocol.

#### <ins>Proof Of Concept</ins>


```
function updateLine: address _line
217: self.line = _line;
```

#### <ins>Recommended Mitigation Steps</ins>

Consider adding explicit zero-address validation on input parameters of address type.



### <a href="#Summary">[LOW&#x2011;2]</a><a name="LOW&#x2011;2"> Unused `receive()` Function Will Lock Ether In Contract

### <a href="#Summary">[LOW&#x2011;3]</a><a name="LOW&#x2011;3"> The Contract Should `approve(0)` First

Some tokens (like USDT L199) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

### <a href="#Summary">[NC&#x2011;5]</a><a name="NC&#x2011;5"> Avoid Floating Pragmas: The Version Should Be Locked

Avoid floating pragmas for non-library contracts.

While floating pragmas make sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of applications, it may be a security risk for application implementations.

A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

It is recommended to pin to a concrete compiler version.

#### <ins>Proof Of Concept</ins>

### <a href="#Summary">[NC&#x2011;7]</a><a name="NC&#x2011;7"> Lines are too long

Usually lines in source code are limited to 80 characters. Today's screens are much larger so it's reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over 164 characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length
