[G-01]x = x + y is cheaper than x += y; 

Usually does not work with struct and mappings.

    credit.deposit += amount;

fix:

    credit.deposit = credit.deposit + amount;

[Gâ€‘02] EMPTY BLOCKS SHOULD BE REMOVED OR EMIT SOMETHING

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be abstract and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...} => if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}). Empty receive()/fallback() payable functions that are not used, can be removed to save deployment gas.
