## Prevent div by 0
### Impact
On several locations in the code precautions are not being taken to not divide by `0`, this would revert the code.

### Proof of Concept
Navigate to the following contracts,
- `decimals` can be 0 and therefore would revert for tokens with 0 decimals
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/f32cb3eeb08663f2456bf6e2fba21e964da3e8ae/contracts/utils/CreditLib.sol#L117
    return price <= 0 ? 0 : (amount * uint(price)) / (1 * 10 ** decimals);

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Recommend making sure division by `0` wonâ€™t occur by checking the variables beforehand and handling this edge case.

## Unused `receive()` function will lock ether in contract
### Summary
If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should `revert`

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should `revert`.



## Missing checks for address(0x0) when assigning values to `address` state or `immutable` variables 
### Summary
Zero address should be checked for state variables, immutable variables. A zero address can lead into problems.

### Mitigation
Check zero address before assigning or using it







## block.timestamp used as time proxy 
### Summary
Risk of using `block.timestamp` for time should be considered. 
### Details
`block.timestamp` is not an ideal proxy for time because of issues with synchronization, miner manipulation and changing block times. 

This kind of issue may affect the code allowing or reverting the code before the expected deadline, modifying the normal functioning or reverting sometimes.

            lastAccrued: block.timestamp





### Mitigation
- Consider the risk of using `block.timestamp` as time proxy and evaluate if block numbers can be used as an approximation for the application logic. Both have risks that need to be factored in. 
- Consider using an oracle for precision


## Front run initializer
### Summary
The initialize function that initializes important contract state can be called by anyone.
### Details
The attacker can initialize the contract before the legitimate deployer, hoping that the victim continues to use the same contract.

In the best case for the victim, they notice it and have to redeploy their contract costing gas.

### Mitigation
Use the constructor to initialize non-proxied contracts.

## Return value not being checked 
### Details
Return values not being checked may lead into unexpected behaviors with functions. Not events/Error are being emitted if that fails, so functions would be called even of not being working as expect.

### Github Permalinks
slitherNotChecked


### Mitigation
Check values and `revert`/`emit` events if needed




# Informational
##  Use of magic numbers is confusing and risky
### Summary
Magic numbers are hardcoded numbers used in the code which are ambiguous to their intended purpose. These should be replaced with constants to make code more readable and maintainable.
### Details
Values are hardcoded and would be more readable and maintainable if declared as a constant

### Github Permalinks

### Mitigation
Replace magic hardcoded numbers with declared constants.

## Naming convention of constants
### Summary
Constant naming convention is all upper case. 
### Details
Some constants are not using proper style.
Constant should be in `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` as per Solidity Style Guide.

    uint32 constant defaultMinCRatio = 3000; // 30.00% minimum collateral ratio

### Mitigation
Rename the constant to uppercase style: `CONSTANTS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`. 




## Different versions of pragma
### Summary
Some of the contracts include an unlocked pragma, e.g., pragma solidity >=0.8.9. 

Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts are not accidentally deployed using an old compiler version with unfixed bugs.

## Bad order of code
### Summary
Clearness of the code is important for the readability and maintainability.
As Solidity guidelines says about declaration order:
1.Type declarations
2.State variables
3.Events
4.Modifiers
5.Functions
Also, state variables order affects to gas in the same way as ordering structs for saving storage slots

## Missing initializer modifier on constructor

### Mitigation
Ensure that the modifier is applied to the implementation contract. If the default constructor is currently being used, it should be changed to be an explicit one with the modifier applied.

### Mitigation
Reduce line length to less than 99 at least to improve maintainability and readability of the code 




## Large multiples of ten should use scientific notation (e.g. 1e6) rather than decimal literals (e.g. 1000000), for readability
### Summary
Multiples of 10 can be declared as constants with scientific notation so it's easier to read them and less prone to miss/exceed a 0 of the expected value.

### Details
Value 10000 can be used in scientific notation
### Github Permalinks
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/f32cb3eeb08663f2456bf6e2fba21e964da3e8ae/contracts/modules/interest-rate/InterestRateCredit.sol#L9
    uint256 constant BASE_DENOMINATOR = 10000;

### Mitigation
Replace hardcoded numbers with constants that represent the scientific corresponding notation

## Use scientific notation (e.g. 1e18) rather than exponentiation (e.g. 10**18)
### Summary
Multiples of 10 can be declared as constants with scientific notation

### Details
Value 10**5 can be used in scientific notation
### Github Permalinks
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/f32cb3eeb08663f2456bf6e2fba21e964da3e8ae/contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol#L42
        uint256 _numerator = collateralValue * 10**5; // scale to 4 decimals


### Mitigation
Consider replacing long 0 numbers and 10**value notation to scientific notation




## State variables that do not change should be constant and written in UPPERCASE
### Summary
`constant` keyword helps with readability of the code and to make sure that they do not change. 

### Details
Code contains state variables that do not change and so they can be declared `constant`

### Github Permalinks
0xNotConstants


### Mitigation
Add constant and change [[[`MaxPeriod` to `MAX_PERIOD`]]]




## Missing error messages in require statements
### Summary
Require/revert statements should include error messages in order to help at monitoring the system.

### Mitigation
Add error messages 

## Inconsistent spacing in for loops
### Impact
For loops are recommended to be declared such as `for (`, however, sometimes are declared as `for(`

### Github Permalinks
- `for(` this are missing a space
