### [L-01] Best Practices to prevent Re-Entrancy

Follow the checks  - effects - interaction practice when writing functions. In addCollateral(), the token is transferred to LineLib first before the amount in self.deposited is changed. It should be the other way round

### [N-01] Avoid using sensitive terms

Use alternative variants, e.g. allowlist/denylist instead of whitelist/blacklist

### [N-02] Constants should be defined rather than using magic numbers

### [N-03] if( should be if ( to match other lines in the file

For universal coding style
