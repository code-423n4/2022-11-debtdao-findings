## Unspecific Compiler Version Pragma

Avoid floating pragmas for non-library contracts.

While floating pragmas make sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of applications, it may be a security risk for application implementations.

A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

It is recommended to pin to a concrete compiler version.

For example:
ðŸ¤¦ Bad:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

ðŸš€ Good:

```
pragma solidity 0.8.4;
```

## Use CamelCase

Consider sticking to using the CamelCase naming convention as it is highly recommended to follow these guidelines to help improve the readability of the source code

## Constants should be named with all capital letters

with underscores separating words. (e.g, `MAX_BLOCKS`, `TOKEN_NAME`, `TOKEN_TICKER`, `CONTRACT_VERSION`).

## `block.timestamp` is unreliable

Using block.timestamp as part of the time checks could be slightly modified by miners/validators to favor them in contracts that contain logic heavily dependent on them.

Consider this problem and warn users that a scenario like this could occur. If the change of timestamps will not affect the protocol in any way, consider documenting the reasoning and writing tests enforcing that these guarantees will be preserved even if the code changes in the future.
