## Use custom errors rather than revert() /require() strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. 
Custom errors save ~50 gas each time they’re hit by avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string. 
Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

## ++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i} /unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for and while loops
The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. 
This saves 30-40 gas per loop

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
i.e, 
```solidity
-- for (uint256 i = 0; i < 255; i++)
++ for (uint256 i = 0; i < 255; uncheck{i++})
```
