## Gas Optimizations Report

### Using `!= 0` on `uints` costs less gas than `> 0`.

This change saves 3 gas per instance/loop

_There are **8** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol

398:  if(facilityFee > 0) {

484:  if(credit.principal > 0) { revert CloseFailedWithPrincipal(); }

526:             credits[id].principal > 0
```

File: contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol

91:    require(amount > 0);

119:          bool is4626 = tokenAddrBytes.length > 0 && passed;

134:          if (decimalBytes.length > 0 && successDecimals) {

161:  require(amount > 0);

198:  require(amount > 0);
```

### It costs more gas to initialize non-`constant`/non-`immutable` variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied

Not overwriting the default for stack variables saves 8 gas. Storage and memory variables have larger savings

_There are **2** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/utils/CreditLib.sol

188:    credit.interestAccrued = 0;

219:    credit.interestRepaid = 0;
```

### Functions that are access-restricted from most users may be marked as `payable`

Marking a function as `payable` reduces gas cost since the compiler does not have to check whether a payment was provided or not. This change will save around 21 gas per function call.

_There are **2** instances of this issue:_

```solidity
File: contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol

104:  function enableCollateral(EscrowState storage self, address oracle, address token) external returns (bool) {

215:  function updateLine(EscrowState storage self, address _line) external returns(bool) {
```

### `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++I}`/`unchecked{I++}` in `for`-loops

When an increment or any arithmetic operation is not possible to overflow it should be placed in `unchecked{}` block. \This is because of the default compiler overflow and underflow safety checks since Solidity version 0.8.0. \In for-loops it saves around 30-40 gas **per loop**

### `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables

_There are **4** instances of this issue:_

```solidity

122:      unusedTokens[credit.token] -= repaid - newTokens;

125:      unusedTokens[credit.token] += newTokens - repaid;

144:  unusedTokens[credit.token] -= amount;

172:  unusedTokens[targetToken] += newTokens;
```

### Usage of `uint`s/`int`s smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

'When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.' \ https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/internals/layout_in_storage.html \ Use a larger size then downcast where needed

### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for function parameters

If a reference type function parameter is read-only, it is cheaper in gas to use calldata instead of memory. Calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory. Try to use calldata as a data location because it will avoid copies and also makes sure that the data cannot be modified.

      /// @audit Store `credit` in calldata.

### Replace `x <= y` with `x < y + 1`, and `x >= y` with `x > y - 1`

In the EVM, there is no opcode for `>=` or `<=`. When using greater than or equal, two operations are performed: `>` and `=`. Using strict comparison operators hence saves gas

### `require()/revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas

Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 incurs an MSTORE which costs 3 gas

```solidity

### Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save ~50 gas each time they're hitby avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string. Not defining the strings also save deployment gas
