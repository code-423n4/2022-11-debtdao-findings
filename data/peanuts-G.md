### [G-01] ++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for- and while-loops

### [G-02] Use a more recent version of solidity

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value. Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.12 to get string.concat() instead of abi.encodePacked (<str>,<str>)

### [G-03] Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declaring the variable with the memory keyword, declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incurring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct.

### [G-04] Redundant Operation
```
    return price <= 0 ? 0 : (amount * uint(price)) / (1 * 10 ** decimals);
```
becomes
```
    return price <= 0 ? 0 : (amount * uint(price)) / (10 ** decimals);
```
