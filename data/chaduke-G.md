G1. add modifier onlyOwner to   function *claimEscrow* in Spigot.sol can save gas since the owner check can be performed first without calling state.claimEscrow(token). (Line 90)
```
function claimEscrow(address token)
        external
        onlyOwner
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 claimed) 
    {
        return state.claimEscrow(token);
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == state.owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }
```
