# G-02 ++I/I++ SHOULD BE UNCHECKED{++I}/UNCHECKED{I++} WHEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OVERFLOW, AS IS THE CASE WHEN USED IN FOR- AND WHILE-LOOPS

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas per loop.

# G-03 Use calldata instead of memory for external functions where the function argument is read-only

On external functions, when using the memory keyword with a function argument, what's happening is that a memory acts as an intermediate.Reading directly from calldata using calldataload instead of going via memory saves the gas from the intermediate memory operations that carry the values.
